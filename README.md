# Insurance Claim Prediction

## Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict insurance claims based on building and policy features.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information such as:
- Building age
- Number of windows
- Settlement type
- Garden availability
- Insurance period

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Feature encoding and scaling
- Logistic Regression model
- Model evaluation

## Results
The model identifies key features influencing claim probability and achieves reasonable predictive performance.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the notebook `insurance_claim_model.ipynb`
